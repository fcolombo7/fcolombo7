<h1>Hey there!</h1>

:wave: I‚Äôm Filippo Colombo and I live near Milan, Italy.

:man_student: I studied at `Politecnico di Milano` where I got my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2022.

__Projects and works__

- Master Thesis: [Transfer learning analysis of fashion image captioning systems](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/187559)  
Design and implementation of deep learning algorithms with the aim of personalizing the user experience in the fashion domain.  
_Tags_: `Computer Vision` `NLP` `Deep Learning` `PyTorch` `ü§ó Transformers`

- [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/AN2DL-2020):  
Use of Deep Learning techniques implemented in TensorFlow to solve challenges dealing with image and text data, such as Image Classification, Visual Question Answering,
and Image Segmentation applied the 1st ACRE Cascade Competition (the goal of the competition was the analysis of agriculture images to distinguish between crop, weeds, and ground).  
_Tags_: `Image Classification` `Image Segmentation` `ResNet` `U-Net` `NLP` `LSTM`

- [Data Intelligence application project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/DataIntelligenceApplications):  
Design and simulation of online learning optimization techniques implemented in Python to determine the best joint bidding and pricing strategy to attract users to an e-commerce website.
Optimization by tuning and combining different online Multi Armed Bandit algorithms such as UCB-like bandits, Thompson sampling bandits and Gaussian Processes bandits.   
_Tags_: `MAB` `TS` `Online Learning` `Scikit-learn` `NumPy`

- [Recommender Systems project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/RecSys-2020):  
Python implementation of a book recommender system. The algorithm works using the interactions between books and users, and the features related to books.
Our approach combines various kind of systems like: Content based, Collaborative and Graph based.
_Tags_: `ScyPy` `Matrix Factorization` `SLIM` `Factorization Machines`

- [Software Engineering project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/ing-sw-2019-craighero-colombo-delvecchio):  
Java implementation, documentation and testing of a distributed and multi-user application with GUI and CLI of the ‚ÄúAdrenaline‚Äù table game. 
_Tags_: `Java` `OOP` `MVC` `Socket` `UI`
